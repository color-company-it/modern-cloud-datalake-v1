# 1.2 Software Development Life Cycle

Following an Agile approach, here are the core Epics, Stories and TIckets one would
expect to set up when developing this datalake solution:

## Epic: Design and implement datalake infrastructure

### Story: Research and evaluate cloud providers

- Task: Create a list of potential cloud providers
- Task: Evaluate the pros and cons of each cloud provider
- Task: Select a cloud provider and set up the datalake infrastructure

## Epic: Integrate existing data sources into the datalake

### Story: Identify existing data sources

- Task: Create a list of all existing data sources
- Task: Determine which data sources are suitable for inclusion in the datalake

### Story: Implement ETL processes for data ingestion

- Task: Develop and test ETL processes for each data source
- Task: Set up scheduled data ingestion from each data source

## Epic: Implement security and access controls for the datalake

### Story: Define roles and permissions for datalake users

- Task: Create a list of user roles and the corresponding permissions for each role
- Task: Implement role-based access controls for the datalake

### Story: Implement encryption for data at rest and in transit

- Task: Research and evaluate encryption options
- Task: Implement encryption for data stored in the datalake and transmitted to and from the datalake

## Epic: Develop and implement a data governance strategy

### Story: Define data governance policies and procedures

- Task: Research best practices for data governance in datalakes
- Task: Develop a set of policies and procedures for data governance in the datalake

### Story: Establish a data governance committee

- Task: Identify stakeholders to be included on the data governance committee
- Task: Set up regular meetings for the data governance committee

## Epic: Monitor and maintain the datalake

### Story: Set up monitoring and alerting for the datalake

- Task: Research and evaluate monitoring and alerting tools
- Task: Implement monitoring and alerting for the datalake

### Story: Perform regular maintenance and upgrades

- Task: Develop a maintenance and upgrade schedule
- Task: Perform regular maintenance and upgrades to ensure the datalake remains performant and secure.

# Documentation

Create easily updatable documentation for Data Engineers who need to record their work in a scalable cloud-based
DataLake.

1. Make a major documentation landing page for all DataLake-related material. Links to all other documentation pages
   should be provided on this page, along with a description of the DataLake and its function.
2. Each significant part of the DataLake should have its own page, such as the security measures and data governance
   guidelines. These pages ought to include a thorough explanation of the component, any necessary implementation
   information, and maintenance and troubleshooting guidelines.
3. For each data source that is imported into the DataLake, create a page. This page ought to include details about the
   data's structure and format, as well as any pertinent metadata and quality checks that are carried out during
   ingestion.
4. Make a page for each schema or data model that is utilized by the DataLake. The data model should be completely
   described on this page, along with any pertinent business logic or data transformations.
5. For each ETL procedure that moves data into the DataLake, create a page. This page must to include a thorough
   explanation of the procedure, any necessary implementation information, and directions for upkeep and
   troubleshooting.
6. Each data product or study that is produced on top of the DataLake should have its own page. This page should include
   a description of the data product, any necessary implementation information, and usage guidelines.
7. Make a page listing typical problems and their fixes. This page ought to provide a list of typical problems that
   could occur when using the DataLake, along with instructions for fixing them.
8. Make a page for DataLake updates and modifications. This page should provide a history of all updates and
   modifications made to the DataLake, as well as any pertinent information and guidelines for putting such
   modifications into action.
9. Make a page with answers to frequently asked questions. When using the DataLake, frequently asked questions should be
   addressed on this page.
10. Make a page with the DataLake team's contact details. The Data Engineers who are in charge of upkeep and updating
    the DataLake should be contact information on this page.
