# 5 API Extract

The ideal technique for extracting data from an API source using PySpark would involve the following steps:

- Use the requests library to make a GET request to the API endpoint, which will return the data as a JSON response.
- Use the json library to parse the JSON response and convert it into a PySpark DataFrame.
- Use the dropDuplicates method on the DataFrame to remove any duplicate rows.
- Use the write method on the DataFrame to write the data to AWS S3 as parquet files, partitioned by the date the data
  was extracted. This can be done using the partitionBy option, which allows you to specify a column to use for
  partitioning the data.

To re-ingest data, you can simply repeat the above steps, making sure to use the mode option in the write method to
specify that you want to append the new data to any existing data in the S3 partition. This will ensure that the new
data is added to the existing data without overwriting it.

Overall, this technique provides a robust and efficient way to extract data from an API source using PySpark, with
built-in support for deduplication and re-ingestion of data.

There are several techniques that can be used to ensure the data ingested from an API is accurate and complete, and to
include metadata about the data being extracted. Some of these techniques include:

1. Validating the data against a schema: Before ingesting the data, you can use PySpark's built-in schema validation
   features to check that the data conforms to a pre-defined schema. This can help ensure that the data has the expected
   structure and data types, and that required fields are present.
2. Using a unique identifier for each record: Many APIs will include a unique identifier for each record in the
   response, such as a primary key or a UUID. You can use this identifier to de-duplicate the data and ensure that no
   records are missed during the ingestion process.
3. Checking the API response for errors: Before parsing the API response, you can check the response code and any error
   messages included in the response to make sure that the API call was successful and that no data is missing.
4. Storing metadata about the data: You can use PySpark to store metadata about the data being extracted, such as the
   API endpoint, the date and time the data was extracted, and the response code and any error messages from the API.
   This metadata can be included as additional columns in the DataFrame, or it can be stored in a separate metadata
   table.

Overall, these techniques can help ensure that the data ingested from an API is accurate and complete, and that any
potential issues are identified and addressed.

## 5.2 Using Dense Rank for API Data Ingestion

A dense rank algorithm using a window function in PySpark can be a useful solution for ranking data, particularly when
ingesting data from an API and storing it in S3 partitioned by the API date-scope. This approach allows you to
efficiently rank the data based on the criteria you specify and can help you quickly analyze and understand the data.

There are several benefits to using a dense rank algorithm in PySpark for this type of data analysis. One benefit is
that it can help you avoid gaps in the ranking. For example, if you have a group of data points and one of them is
missing, a dense rank algorithm will assign the next rank in the sequence to the next available data point, rather than
skipping the missing data point and leaving a gap in the ranking. This can make the results of your analysis more
accurate and easier to interpret.

Another benefit of using a window function in PySpark is that it allows you to easily perform rankings over a specific
time frame or date range. For example, you can use a window function to rank data based on the date it was ingested from
the API, which can be helpful for tracking trends and patterns over time.

One limitation of using a dense rank algorithm in PySpark is that it can be computationally intensive, especially for
large datasets. This means it may not be suitable for real-time analysis of streaming data, as it may not be able to
keep up with the incoming data. Additionally, dense rank algorithms can be difficult to implement and may require a
certain level of expertise with PySpark and data analysis in general.

Overall, a dense rank algorithm using a window function in PySpark can be a powerful tool for analyzing data ingested
from an API and stored in S3, particularly when partitioned by the API date-scope. It offers several benefits, including
the ability to avoid gaps in the ranking and to perform rankings over specific time frames or date ranges. However, it
can also be computationally intensive and may require a certain level of expertise to implement effectively.
