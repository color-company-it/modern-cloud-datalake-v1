# ECS PySpark Cluster

To set up an AWS ECS cluster using Terraform for PySpark, you will need to perform the following steps:

1. Define an Amazon ECS task definition for your PySpark application. This will specify the Docker image to use for your
   application, as well as any other requirements such as CPU and memory limits. For example:

```terraform
resource "aws_ecs_task_definition" "pyspark_task" {
  family = "pyspark-task"

  container_definitions = <<EOF
[
  {
    "name": "pyspark",
    "image": "my-pyspark-image",
    "cpu": 1024,
    "memory": 2048,
    "essential": true
  }
]
EOF
}
```

2. Define an Amazon ECS service to run your PySpark task on your cluster. This will specify the number of task instances
   to run, as well as the load balancer and target group to use for the service:

```terraform
resource "aws_ecs_service" "pyspark_service" {
  name            = "pyspark-service"
  cluster         = aws_ecs_cluster.my_cluster.id
  task_definition = aws_ecs_task_definition.pyspark_task.arn
  desired_count   = 1

  load_balancer {
    target_group_arn = aws_lb_target_group.pyspark_tg.arn
    container_name   = "pyspark"
    container_port   = 80
  }
}
```

3. Define the necessary resources for your load balancer and target group, such as an Amazon Elastic Load Balancer (ELB)
   and an Amazon VPC:

```terraform
resource "aws_lb" "pyspark_lb" {
  name               = "pyspark-lb"
  internal           = false
  load_balancer_type = "application"
  security_groups    = [aws_security_group.pyspark_sg.id]
  subnets            = [aws_subnet.pyspark_subnet_a.id, aws_subnet.pyspark_subnet_b.id]
}

resource "aws_lb_target_group" "pyspark_tg" {
  name     = "pyspark-tg"
  port     = 80
  protocol = "HTTP"
  vpc_id   = aws_vpc.pyspark_vpc.id
}
```

# Import a .zip file of a Python module into AWS Glue.

1. First, create a new Python shell Glue ETL job or open an existing one.
2. In the Glue ETL job, go to the "Scripting" tab and scroll down to the "Import Libraries" section.
3. Click on the "Add Python library" button and select the "Upload Python Egg or PyPi package" option.
4. Browse to the location of the .zip file on your local machine and upload it.
5. After the .zip file is uploaded, it will be added to the list of imported libraries. You can then use the imported
   module in your Glue ETL job by importing it in your script and using it as you would any other Python module.
