# 4.6 Monitoring

This part is in charge of keeping an eye on the performance and general well-being of the ETL solution and issuing
alerts in the event that any problems or faults are found. A variety of methods, like log analysis, performance
measures, or machine learning, may be used by the monitoring and alerting component to monitor the system and spot
potential issues.

# Severity Levels

It's important to have a clear and well-defined set of severity levels in place to ensure that issues with the DataLake
environment are properly prioritized and addressed in a timely manner. This will help ensure that the DataLake
environment remains stable and reliable for users.

1. **Critical**: This is the highest severity level and indicates a serious issue that needs immediate attention. This
   could include the complete loss of a critical component of the DataLake environment, such as the loss of a data
   storage server, or a major security breach.
2. **High**: This severity level indicates a significant issue that needs to be addressed as soon as possible. This
   could include a partial loss of functionality in a critical component of the DataLake environment, or a significant
   performance degradation that is impacting users.
3. **Medium**: This severity level indicates a problem that needs to be addressed, but is not as urgent as a High or
   Critical issue. This could include minor performance degradation, or a non-critical component of the DataLake
   environment that is experiencing issues.
4. **Low**: This is the lowest severity level and indicates a problem that is not critical and can be addressed at a
   later time. This could include issues with non-critical components of the DataLake environment, or minor cosmetic
   issues.

The index is set as follows in `codebase.monitoring_mappings`:

```python
CRITICAL_INDEX = {
    "Critical": {
        "dev": 10,
        "int": 20,
        "qa": 30,
        "prod": 40
    },
    "High": {
        "dev": 8,
        "int": 16,
        "qa": 24,
        "prod": 32
    },
    "Medium": {
        "dev": 6,
        "int": 12,
        "qa": 18,
        "prod": 24
    },
    "Low": {
        "dev": 4,
        "int": 8,
        "qa": 12,
        "prod": 16
    }
}
```

To use this dictionary, you would specify the severity level and the stage in which the issue occurred, and it would
return the corresponding number. For example:

```python
severity = "Medium"
stage = "prod"
severity_level = severity_levels[severity][stage]
```

The critical index is a numerical value that indicates the relative severity of an issue. It is typically used in
conjunction with the severity level to provide a more granular level of detail about the issue.

For example, if an issue is classified as "Critical", the critical index can be used to indicate whether it is a minor
issue that can be addressed quickly, or a major issue that requires immediate attention. A critical index of 1 would
indicate a minor issue, while a critical index of 5 would indicate a major issue.

The critical index can be used in combination with the severity level to determine the overall severity of an issue. For
example, if an issue is classified as "Critical" with a critical index of 5, it would be considered a major issue that
requires immediate attention. However, if the same issue was classified as "Critical" with a critical index of 1, it
would be considered a minor issue that can be addressed at a later time.

In the example Python dictionary provided in the previous response, the critical index is used to adjust the severity
level numbers based on the relative severity of the issue.

> For example, an issue classified as "Critical" with a critical index of 1 would have a severity level number of 10 if
> it occurred in the development stage, while the same issue with a critical index of 5 would have a severity level
> number
> of 6 in the development stage.

Here are some examples of how the critical index could be used in different types of failures:

- A failure in a data storage server that results in the complete loss of data would be classified as "Critical" with a
  critical index of 5. This indicates that the failure is a major issue that requires immediate attention to prevent
  further data loss.
- A failure in a data processing component that slows down data processing by 50% would be classified as "High" with a
  critical index of 4. This indicates that the failure is a significant issue that needs to be addressed as soon as
  possible, but is not as severe as the complete loss of data.
- A failure in a data visualization tool that prevents users from being able to view certain types of data would be
  classified as "Medium" with a critical index of 3. This indicates that the failure is a problem that needs to be
  addressed, but is not as urgent as a High or Critical issue.
- A failure in a data backup system that results in a temporary loss of access to backup data would be classified as "
  Low" with a critical index of 2. This indicates that the failure is a minor issue that can be addressed at a later
  time.

In each of these examples, the critical index provides a more detailed and accurate assessment of the severity of the
failure, which can help ensure
