Obsidian is a powerful, open-source documentation application that allows you to create, organize, and share your notes
and ideas. With Obsidian, you can create your own "brain" by connecting your notes together with links and
relationships, creating a network of ideas and knowledge that is easy to navigate and explore.

To use Obsidian, you first need to download and install the application on your computer. Once you have installed
Obsidian, you can create a new "vault" to store your notes and ideas. A vault is a collection of notes that are
organized into folders and sub-folders, and can be linked together using Obsidian's linking and relationship features.

To create a new note in Obsidian, you can simply click the "New Note" button and enter a title for your note. You can
then use Obsidian's markdown editor to add text, images, code blocks, and other content to your note. You can also use
the linking and relationship features to connect your notes together and create a network of ideas and knowledge.

Once you have created your notes and linked them together, you can use Obsidian's search and navigation features to
easily find and explore your notes. You can also use Obsidian's tagging and filtering features to organize and classify
your notes, making it easier to find the information that you are looking for.
